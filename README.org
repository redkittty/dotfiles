These are my dotfiles
* Install
In order to install my dotfiles do this:

#+begin_src zsh
git clone https://github.com/redkittty/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && chmod +x ADPDS/boot.sh && bash ADPDS/boot.sh
#+end_src

A script will automatically be loaded to install the dotfiles and related programs

The script is based on another project I have called [[https://github.com/redkittty/ADPDS][ADPDS (Automated Dotfiles and Programs Deployment Script)]]

Currently, the Script only supports Arch Linux


My dotfiles contain configs for:

- Alacritty

- AwesomeWM

- ZSH

- Git

- Doom Emacs
